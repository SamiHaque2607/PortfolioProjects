# No. of Trainings: The number of trainings attended by employees has a very weak negative correlation (-0.086) with their age. This means that younger employees tend to participate in slightly more training sessions compared to older employees.

# Age: Age shows a weak positive correlation (0.017) with the previous year rating. This indicates that as employees get older, they tend to receive slightly higher ratings in their performance assessments from the previous year.

# Previous Year Rating: There is a very weak positive correlation (0.056) between the previous year rating and the average training score. This suggests that employees who received higher ratings in the previous year's performance assessment tend to have slightly higher average training scores.

# Length of Service: The length of service in the company has a relatively stronger positive correlation (0.601) with age. This means that as employees grow older, they tend to have a longer tenure or history of working with the company.

# Avg Training Score: There is a very weak positive correlation (0.045) between the average training score and the number of trainings attended. This suggests that employees who attend more training sessions tend to have slightly higher average training scores.
