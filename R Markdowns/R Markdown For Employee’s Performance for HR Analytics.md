## Load Packages

```{r packages, message=FALSE}
library(readxl)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(ggthemes)
```

In the provided R code, four packages were utilized for different purposes. The **readxl** package enabled the reading of data from an Excel file into R, allowing the manipulation of the data as data frames for subsequent analysis. 

Utilizing the  **ggplot2** package, bar plots were generated, visualizing the relationships between color-band combinations and their corresponding frequencies for different snail categories in a customizable and visually appealing manner. 

I also utilized the **dplyr** package to efficiently manipulate and summarize the data before creating the bar plots. The **dplyr** package is a powerful tool for data wrangling and transformation in R. With its intuitive and expressive syntax, **dplyr** allows for seamless data manipulation, making it easier to filter, arrange, group, and summarize data for visualization.

In addition, I utilized the **ggthemes** package to further enhance the visual aesthetics of the bar plots. The **ggthemes** package provides a collection of custom themes and color palettes for **ggplot2**, allowing for even more visually appealing and professional-looking visualizations.

## Importing Data

```{r Importing, message=FALSE}
data <- read_excel('/Users/samihaque/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-Personal/Projects/R/Employee Performance/Uncleaned_employees_dataset.xlsx')
head(data)
```

This data was sourced from **Kaggle** (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sanjanchaudhari/employees-performance-for-hr-analytics), called Employeeâ€™s Performance for HR Analytics, and was provided by **Sanjana Chaudhari**

## Data Pre-Proccessing

```{r Processing, }
data <- na.omit(data)
str(data)
```

First, I removed any rows that contained missing or "NA" values from the dataset using the **na.omit()** function. By doing so, I ensured that the dataset only contained complete and relevant information, which would help maintain the accuracy of our analysis and visualizations.

Next, I used the **str()** function to inspect the data types of each column in the dataset. This step provided me with valuable information about how the data was stored and organized. Understanding the data types of variables, such as numerical, categorical, or date formats, was crucial for appropriate data handling and visualization.

These data preprocessing steps allowed me to create a solid foundation for robust and meaningful data exploration in my project. By removing missing values and gaining insights into the structure of the dataset, I could confidently proceed with subsequent data analysis and visualization processes.

```{r Summary, }
summary(data[, c("no_of_trainings", "age", "previous_year_rating", "length_of_service", "KPIs_met_more_than_80", "awards_won", "avg_training_score")])
```

I used the **summary()** function to generate a concise yet informative summary of key statistical measures for specific columns in the dataset **"data."** By selecting relevant columns, including **"no_of_trainings," "age," "previous_year_rating," "length_of_service," "KPIs_met_more_than_80," "awards_won,"** and **"avg_training_score,"** I obtained insights into the central tendency and spread of the numeric variables, as well as the frequency distribution of categorical variables.

The summary provided me with essential statistics such as **minimum** and **maximum values**, **1st** and **3rd** quartiles (25th and 75th percentiles), and the **median** (2nd quartile or 50th percentile) for each selected column. Additionally, for categorical variables, it displayed the frequency count of each unique category, allowing me to grasp the **distribution of different categories** within those variables.

By using the **summary()** function, I efficiently obtained an initial understanding of the data distribution and gained valuable insights into the characteristics of the variables of interest. This summary served as a foundation for further data exploration and analysis, enabling me to make informed decisions and draw meaningful conclusions in my project.

## Calculating Correlation 

I performed a correlation analysis to explore the relationship between engagement scores and various performance metrics. The code first calculated the correlation coefficients among the selected performance metrics, namely **"no_of_trainings," "age," "previous_year_rating," "length_of_service,"** and **"avg_training_score."** The **cor()** function was used to compute the correlation matrix, which provides insights into the strength and direction of the linear relationships between these variables.

```{r Corrleation, }
correlation_matrix <- cor(data[, c("no_of_trainings", "age", "previous_year_rating", "length_of_service", "avg_training_score")])
print(correlation_matrix)
```

Upon executing the code, the correlation matrix was printed, displaying the **correlation coefficients** between the performance metrics. Positive correlation values indicate a positive linear relationship, while negative values suggest a negative linear relationship. A correlation coefficient close to **1** or **-1** suggests a **strong correlation**, whereas values near **0** indicate a **weak or no linear relationship**.

#### Findings from the correlation analysis:

- **No. of Trainings:** The number of trainings attended by employees has a **very weak negative correlation** (-0.086) with their age. This means that younger employees tend to participate in slightly more training sessions compared to older employees.
- **Age:** Age shows a **weak positive correlation** (0.017) with the previous year rating. This indicates that as employees get older, they tend to receive slightly higher ratings in their performance assessments from the previous year.
- **Previous Year Rating:** There is a **very weak positive correlation** (0.056) between the previous year rating and the average training score. This suggests that employees who received higher ratings in the previous year's performance assessment tend to have slightly higher average training scores.
- **Length of Service:** The length of service in the company has a **relatively stronger positive correlation** (0.601) with age. This means that as employees grow older, they tend to have a longer tenure or history of working with the company.
- **Avg Training Score:** There is a **very weak positive correlation** (0.045) between the average training score and the number of trainings attended. This suggests that employees who attend more training sessions tend to have slightly higher average training scores.

## Clearing Up

```{r clearing, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
rm(list = ls())
invisible(dev.off())
```

The two lines of code provided perform essential tasks in an R script. The first line, **rm(list = ls())**, clears the R environment by removing all existing objects from memory. This step ensures a clean slate for the script, preventing potential conflicts or interference from previously defined variables. The second line, **invisible(dev.off()**, turns off the current graphics device used by ggplot, which is a commonly used package for creating data visualizations. By closing the graphics device, system resources are freed up, and plots are fully rendered and saved before moving on to other tasks. Together, these lines facilitate efficient memory management and a fresh start for the script's execution.
